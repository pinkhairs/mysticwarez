    <p>Hello kindred souls! My name is Diana, and I'm the proud first member of Mysticwarez. This is my introduction post. A little about me: I'm a long-time software developer. From 12 years old making Hello Kitty fansites to industry professional, I've always leaned on community to draw inspiration from the endless possibilities that technology holds.</p>
    <p>After many years of not believing in anything mystical or magical, I was suddenly called to read tarot. At the same time I was teaching myself illustration. I ended up creating Kawaii Tarot and Spoopy Tarot which are now published tarot decks and available in stores worldwide.</p>
    <p>I also created an app called Cute Tarot (check it out on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cute-tarot/id6670729684" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cutetarot.app" target="_blank">Android</a>) for reading with my decks.</p>
    <p>I was inspired to create the Mysticwarez community because the powers of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while developing the Cute Tarot app took me by surprise... Maybe handcrafting websites from scratch seems like a throwback. After all, isn't this more of a Myspace-age thing?</p>
    <p>But the foundational web languages have gotten comprehensive enough that there are so many more possibilities than what <a href="https://www.lissaexplains.com/fun.shtml" target="_blank">Lissa</a> explained. But the code itself is just as accessible as it was back then.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being here. I can't wait to see what you create.</p>
