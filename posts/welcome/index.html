          <p>Hello kindred souls! My name is Diana, and I'm the proud first member of Mysticwarez. This is my introduction post.</p>
          <p>So a little about me: I'm a long-time software developer. From 12 years old making Hello Kitty fansites to industry professional, I've always leaned on community to draw inspiration from the endless possibilities that technology holds.</p>
          <p>After many years of not believing in anything mystical or magical, I was suddenly called to read tarot. At the same time I was teaching myself illustration. I ended up creating Kawaii Tarot and Spoopy Tarot which are now published tarot decks and available in stores worldwide.</p>
          <p>I also created an app called Cute Tarot (check it out on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cute-tarot/id6670729684" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cutetarot.app" target="_blank">Android</a>) for reading with my decks.</p>
          <p>I was inspired to create the Mysticwarez community because the powers of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while developing the Cute Tarot app took me aback.</p>
          <p>Maybe handcrafting websites from scratch seems like a throwback. After all, isn't this more of a Myspace-age thing? But the foundational web languages have gotten comprehensive enough that there are so many more possibilities than what <a href="https://www.lissaexplains.com/fun.shtml" target="_blank">Lissa</a> explained. But (and this is the exciting part) the code itself is just as accessible as it was back then.</p>
          <p>I also find I learn best when I was doing actual projects, not just learning abstract concepts. As such, this site's tutorials are full projects from beginning to endâ€”whether that's building a digital book of shadows or a digital astrology cheatsheet.</p>
          <p>So, here we are! Mysticwarez' source code is made of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's available for download on <a href="https://github.com/pinkhairs/mysticwarez" target="_blank">Github</a> (a popular code host).</p>
