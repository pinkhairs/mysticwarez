          <h2>What is tech witchcraft?</h2>
          <p>Technology and magic might seem like they don't mix, but actually, technology can really help with witchcraft's focus on nature and spirit. Witches are practical, creative, and brave, making them great at using technology to make their magic even better. With things like digital spell books and online rituals, technology helps witches do more with their craft and improve their everyday lives.</p>
