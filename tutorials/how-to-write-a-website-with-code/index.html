          <h3>Meet Visual Studio Code</h3>
          <p>Download Visual Studio Code by heading to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">code.visualstudio.com</a>. This powerful editor works slightly differently from Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Because it's meant for code, it won't autoformat anything, keeping your code just as you intend it to be.</p>
          <p>Finish the installation process for VS Code.</p>
          <p>Also, I recommend hiding all the gizmos and widgets on Visual Studio Code that you won't be using yet, just to keep a distraction-free environment.</p>
          <p>Right-click every icon or label that you see, and un-checkmark it. Except for the most top-left button named Explorer.</p>
          <p>Here's a handy GIF guide.</p>

          <p>Open the folder, with Visual Studio Code, on your computer where you've stored the cloned Mysticwarez repository. If it asks you if you trust the author, say yes, as it's your own desktop.</p>
          <h3>Fire up the site</h3>
          <p>Let's install an extension to give this code folder a URL of sorts on your computer. There are a few buttons on the left-hand side. If you hover over them, they'll tell you what they contain. Hover over each one until you find the one with blocks that's called <strong>Extensions</strong>. Click on it and search for "Live Preview" by Microsoft. Click the <strong>Install</strong> button and refresh, if it prompts you to.</p>
          <p>Navigate back to the first tab on the left hand side called <strong>Explorer</strong>. If there are open folders, collapse them (by clicking the triangle on the left-hand side) to get a clearer view.</p>
          <p>Find the index.html that's almost last in the list of files. This means it's not in any folder inside the project folder—it's at the "root" directory. Right-click that index.html and select Show Preview from the list.</p>
          <p>You'll notice a new panel opened up, with a mini-browser and the URL <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html</code></p>
          <p>127.0.0.1 is your computer's name for itself. It's "home." 3000 is a port number—it's like a room that your computer is reserving for your website.</p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/home.jpg" class="cover-image"></p>
          <p>If this mini-browser is getting in the way, copy the URL and paste it into your full browser, whether Chrome, Safari, or Edge. It'll work the same. Then you can click the X in the mini-browser tab to go back to the full code view.</p>
