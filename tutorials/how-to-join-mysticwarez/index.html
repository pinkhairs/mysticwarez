          <h2><span class="lesson-number">01.</span> Get the lay of the land</h2>
          <p>Welcome to our community! 🎉 Let’s take a moment to get a good overview of this first step.</p>
          <p>Your task is posting an introduction to Mysticwarez homepage. This is an in-depth tutorial covering all the coding necessary to publish to our live website.</p>
          <p><strong>You don't need prior coding experience.</strong> We'll walk you through everything.</p>
          <h3>Steps:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Download Mysticwarez' code (with Github)</li>
            <li>Create your post (with HTML and Visual Studio Code)</li>
            <li>Upload it to the site (with Github again)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This tutorial will guide you through each step. Posting should take about 30 or 45 minutes, depending on your speed. Taking breaks is OK.</p>
          <p>If you get stuck, don't tear your hair out—ask for a helping hand on <a href="https://discord.gg/YJSd4eFuRN" target="_blank">the Discord</a> or <a href="#replies">leave a reply</a> on this page. We're very friendly!</p>
          <p>Our philosophy is to learn as we go. So, let's get started.</p>
        </div>
      </article>
      <article class="post-card">
        <div class="post-content">
          <h2><span class="lesson-number">02.</span> Download Mysticwarez' code</h2>
          <p>Fantastic, you're ready! We'll start by downloading the code you need from our "GitHub repository."</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>💡 Github repository?</h3>
            <p>Github is a site to store code. It handles keeping your code in the cloud (in case anything happens to your computer).</p>
            <p>A repository — or "repo" for short — is the folder for a project.</p>
          </div>
          <p>The easiest way to do this is with Github Desktop. Visit the Github Desktop site by clicking the button below, and pick the download for your computer. (Windows, Mac, or Linux.)</p>
          <p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/" target="_blank" class="button">Visit Github Desktop</a></p>
          <p>Set up the application on your computer. Then, open it. Find the link that says <strong>Create Your Free Account</strong>. Click it, and follow the instructions to finish setting up Github. Be sure to set a name and email to identify yourself amongst the community.</p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/github-configure.png" class="cover-image"></p>
          <p>On the next screen, it'll say <strong>Let's get started!</strong></p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, click the button that says 📄 Clone a Repository from the Internet.</p>
          <p>Click the last tab that says URL, and enter this Github username and repository name: <code>pinkhairs/mysticwarez</code> (Logically, pinkhairs is <a href="/posts/welcome" target="_blank">Diana's</a> username. mysticwarez is the repo name.)</p>
          <p><em>Take note of where the "local path" (the project folder on your computer) is! We recommend putting this project in a folder on your desktop.</em></p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/github-clone.png" class="cover-image"></p>
          <p>Click the <strong>Clone</strong> button. This will download a copy of the whole Mysticwarez website onto your computer! This way you can preview exactly how your introduction post will look.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>📂 What's a clone?</h3>
            <p>It's a completely separate copy of the "live" website on mysticwarez.com, to do anything you want with. Changes made to this code won't affect other users, so don't worry, experiment to your heart's content.</p>
            <p>However, this project is still <em>tied</em> to the Github repo. Once you're ready, you can request to upload your post to the live website seamlessly with the Github desktopo app.</p>
            <p>Note there is a review process before your code is actually published, just to prevent bad apples from affecting the site.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Hooray, you made it through! Let's now dive into creating your introduction post with HTML and Visual Studio Code.</p>
        </div>
      </article>
      <article class="post-card">
        <div class="post-content">
          <h2><span class="lesson-number">03.</span> Create your post</h2>
          <p>Now the real fun begins! 🎨 You've got the code, so it's time to start crafting your very own introduction post. Don't worry if you're new to HTML or JavaScript — I'll guide you through every step, and there's no pressure to get it perfect on the first try. Mistakes are just part of the learning process, and everything is safe here.</p>
          <h3>Meet Visual Studio Code</h3>
          <p>Download Visual Studio Code by heading to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">code.visualstudio.com</a>. This powerful editor allows you to work directly from your browser. It works slightly differently from Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Because it's meant for code, it won't autoformat anything, keeping your code just as you intend it to be.</p>
          <p>Finish the installation process for VS Code, and open the folder on your computer where you've stored the cloned Mysticwarez repository. If it asks you if you trust the author, say yes, as it's your own desktop.</p>
          <h3>Fire up the site</h3>
          <p>Let's install an extension to give this code folder a URL of sorts on your computer. There are a few buttons on the left-hand side. If you hover over them, they'll tell you what they contain. Hover over each one until you find the one with blocks that's called <strong>Extensions</strong>. Click on it and search for "Live Preview" by Microsoft. Click the <strong>Install</strong> button and refresh, if it prompts you to.</p>
          <p>Navigate back to the first tab on the left hand side called <strong>Explorer</strong>. If there are open folders, collapse them (by clicking the triangle on the left-hand side) to get a clearer view.</p>
          <p>Find the index.html that's almost last in the list of files. This means it's not in any folder inside the project folder—it's at the "root" directory. Right-click that index.html and select Show Preview from the list.</p>
          <p>You'll notice a new panel opened up, with a mini-browser and the URL <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html</code></p>
          <p>127.0.0.1 is your computer's name for itself. It's "home." 3000 is a port number—it's like a room that your computer is reserving for your website.</p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/home.jpg" class="cover-image"></p>
          <p>If this mini-browser is getting in the way, copy the URL and paste it into your full browser, whether Chrome, Safari, or Edge. It'll work the same. Then you can click the X in the mini-browser tab to go back to the full code view.</p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/live-preview.png" class="cover-image"></p>
          <h3>Copy the first intro post as a base</h3>
          <p>There is a <code>posts</code> folder. Find the <code>welcome</code> folder in the <code>posts</code> folder.</p>
          <p>Copy the entire <code>welcome</code> folder by right-clicking the folder and selecting "Copy." Then click the <code>posts</code> folder again. Right-click <code>posts</code> and click Paste from the options. Rename this copied folder to welcome-<code>your-username-here</code>, replacing <code>your-username-here</code> with your actual username.</p>
          <p>Clear out existing images by navigating into the images folder inside your new welcome-<code>your-username-here</code> folder and deleting the images there. This will ensure you start with a clean slate for your own images.</p>
          <h3>Craft the preview of your intro post</h3>
          <p>Open the <code>post.html</code> file in your new welcome-<code>your-username-here</code> folder. This is where you'll write a short version of your introduction post for the homepage list of posts.</p>
          <p>Let's be fearless, and take a close look at this code.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>&#x3C;article class=&#x22;post-card&#x22;&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x3C;div class=&#x22;post-content&#x22;&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x3C;h2&#x3E;Welcome &#x1F917; to the digital coven for tech witches! &#x1F31F;&#x1F52E;&#x2728;&#x3C;/h2&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;/posts/welcome-${yourUsername}/images/cover.jpg&#x22; alt=&#x22;Welcome to Mysticwarez&#x22; class=&#x22;cover-image&#x22;&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hello kindred souls! My name is [Your Name], and I&#x27;m &nbsp;&nbsp;excited to join Mysticwarez. This is my introduction post.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Here&#x2019;s a little about me...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;/posts/welcome-${yourUsername}/index.html&#x22; class=&#x22;button&#x22;&#x3E;Continue Reading&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x3C;/div&#x3E;</li>
            <li>&#x3C;/article&#x3E;</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Line 1: HTML is text. We use "tags" to describe the job of the text inside. A tag looks like this: less than angle bracket (&lt;) then the <code>tag name</code> and then greater than angle bracket (&gt;). Every tag we open with this code, we eventually have to close, to keep everything neat. We'll cover that later.</p>
          <p>In this line, we're saying we want to create an "article" that has one class (or type) — post-card. We can use classes to make specific types of articles look differently from each other. Let's move on.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>🧪 Experimentation is OK</h3>
            <p>Curious about the job of each part of the code? Try changing something. See what happens. Don't worry about breaking things! You always have the undo button.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Line 2: A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is short for a "divider" tag. It's a way to contain code and keep it separate from other code that's not related to it. This divider or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is for containing the post content, as you can see by the <code>post-content</code> class.</p>
          <p>Line 3: This <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag stands for heading level 2. You may recognize this pattern from editing documents or essays. If not, just know the level 2 heading comes after the level 1 heading (the page title) and the less important level 3 heading.</p>
          <p>This is where you add your greeting, or introduction title! Go ahead and edit the text inside <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code></p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/headings.jpg" alt="Example of headings h1 through h6" class="cover-image"></p>
          <p>Line 4: The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is for including an image in your article. <code>src="urlhere"</code> denotes the image source, which is contained inside the double quotes. Add an image to your images folder and call it something simple like me.jpg or me.png. * Note JPG and PNG work best on the web! If you have another format, try using <a href="https://cloudconvert.com" target="_blank">CloudConvert.com</a> to convert it to either of these formats.</p>
          <p><code>alt="alternative text here"</code> denotes the text that describes the image for people using screen readers to browse the web. This includes people with vision impairment. Fill this in, again staying within the double quotes, and paint a rich picture of your photo with words—try to not use double quotes in your alternative text, as that'll be confusing for the HTML.</p>
          <p>Line 5-6: You're doing great so far! Next, a paragraph tag looks like this: <code>&lt;p&gt;Paragraph text&lt;/p&gt;</code>. Use as many paragraphs as you need, stacked on top of each other to create your first "Hello world!" to our community.</p>
          <p>Feel free to mix in images.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>👋🏼 Tips for a friendly introduction</h3>
            <p>Share your name, where you're from, and what you're excited about. Maybe you're a student, a professional, or a hobbyist. What are you hoping to learn from Mysticwarez? What are you hoping to contribute? Be authentic, be yourself!</p>
          </div>
          <p>Line 7 is an "anchor tag": &lt;a&gt;. This will create a link to another page. In this case, it has the class of <code>button</code>, and it's HTTP reference (href) is /posts/welcome-your-username-here/#replies.  Edit the folder name between /posts/ and /#replies.</p>
          <p>Line 8 is closing that <code>div</code> we opened earlier with <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
          <p>Line 9 is closing that <code>article</code> we opened earlier with <code>&lt;/article&gt;</code></p>
          <p>Now, let's go back to the homepage and see how your post looks. But alas, it's not there! That's ok. Let's learn how to add it to the list of posts to display.</p>
        </div>
      </article>
      <article class="post-card">
        <div class="post-content">
          <h2><span class="lesson-number">04.</span> List your intro post</h2>
          <p>Now that you've crafted your introduction post, it's time to add it to the list of posts on the homepage.</p>
          <p>Press CTRL + P on Windows or CMD + P on Mac. This shortcut opens a quick file search within your project, making it easy to jump to different files without navigating through folders. Type "community" and find the file called "list-community-posts.js" inside the scripts folder. Click on it.</p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/cmd-p.png" class="cover-image"></p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>💭 Understanding list-community-posts.js</h3>
            <p>This JavaScript file is what we call a "blackbox" — it works in the background to handle listing posts on the homepage. For now, you don't need to worry about how it works internally. Think of it like you think of a washing machine. It just works, even if you don't know the underlying technology</p>
          </div>
          <p>All we're gonna do is add your new welcome-<code>your-username-here</code> folder to the top of the list.</p>
          <p>Find the line that says <code>const posts = [</code> and add a new line right below it. Inside the square brackets, add the following line:</p>
          <p><code>'welcome-your-username-here',</code></p>
          <p>Mind the single quotes and comma, but no worries on mistakes! You can always try again. Save the file by pressing CTRL + S on Windows or CMD + S on Mac.</p>
          <p>Now let's go back to the homepage... your post is there!</p>
        </div>
      </article>
      <article class="post-card">
        <div class="post-content">
          <h2><span class="lesson-number">05.</span> Publish your post</h2>
          <p><strong>Congratulations, you've accomplished so much!</strong> Now that you've created your introduction post, it's time to publish it to the live site. This way, everyone can see your beautiful work!</p
          <p>Open Github Desktop. You should see the changes you've made to the code. They'll be listed on the left-hand side. You can see the files you've changed, and the new files you've added.</p>
          <p>See the top bar, where the first two blocks says, from left to right, Repository and Current Branch?</p>
          <p>We're going to create your own branch to make propose changes to the site from. This will keep everything neat and tidy. Think of yourself as a bird on a branch, and the others have their own branch. It's good to have a boundary.</p>
          <p>Click on the Current Branch block.</p>
          <p>Click the "New Branch" button.</p>
          <p>Name your branch <code>welcome-your-username-here</code>.</p>
          <p>When it asks what you want to do with your changed files, click the second option—<strong>Bring my changes to <code>welcome-your-username-here</code></strong>.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>🌿 Branching out</h3>
            <p>This step can pass by quickly. If you make a mistake, feel free to ask for a helping hand on <a href="https://discord.gg/YJSd4eFuRN" target="_blank">the Discord</a> or <a href="#replies">leave a reply</a> on this page.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Now that you've changed your current branch (you should see a new name on the "Current Branch" block) it's time to <strong>commit</strong> changes, and then <strong>push</strong> them.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>🔒 Committing vs. pushing</h3>
            <p>Committing is like saving your work. It's a way to say, "I'm done with this part of the project." Pushing is like sending your work to the cloud, so others can see it.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Write a summary of your changes, like "add my intro post" in the single-line textarea at the bottom left of the screen. You can ignore the description for now.</p>
          <p>Your changes will seem to disappear—but they're saved on your computer. Now it's time to upload them to the cloud.</p>
          <p>Push the big "Publish Branch" button.</p>
          <p>Awesome.</p>
          <p>Now, click the "Preview Pull Request" button.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>🔍 Pull Request</h3>
            <p>Think of a pull request like a request to the site owner to publish your changes into the live site. It's a way to say, "Hey, I've made some changes. Can you take a look?" This is the step where we'll give feedback on your code and make sure it's as amazing as it can be.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Inside the popup that comes up, click the "Create Pull Request" button. It should open Github.com, on a page called Open Pull Request.</p>
          <p>Write anything you want to note during your code review, like things you're especially proud of, or anything you're unsure on.</p>
          <p><img src="/tutorials/how-to-join-mysticwarez/images/pr.png" class="cover-image"></p>
          <p>Scroll down to the "Create Pull Request" button.</p>
          <p>Wonderful! 😄 Now, you'll get an email with personalized code feedback. And when everything's clear, your intro will be published within an hour or so!</p>
          <p><strong>Congratulations! 🎉</strong> Thank you for being a part of Mysticwarez. We can't wait to see what you create next. (Maybe not today — you've already accomplished a lot today!)</p>
